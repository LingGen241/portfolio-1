                        <p>I'm Huy, a 19-year-old Informatics student at the University of Washington with a passion for
                            turning complexity into practical solutions. I thrive at the intersection of technology and
                            collaboration, always eager to learn new tools and frameworks. My goal is to build systems
                            that empower others and make information accessible.</p>

                    <h2>What I Do</h2>
                    <p>I guide projects from concept to completion, aligning stakeholders and leading teams with a clear
                        vision. By breaking work into manageable sprints, I keep progress transparent and adaptable.
                        Along the way, I champion continuous learning and shared ownership to drive meaningful results.

                    <h2>My Methodology</h2>
                    <p>I live by an Agile mindset. I iterate quickly, gather feedback, and refine relentlessly. Empathy
                        and open communication guide everything I do at work and in life. I don’t believe in "work-life
                        balance"—to me, work is life, and life is work. If I ever feel the two are separate, it means
                        I’m doing something wrong. Instead, I weave my passion for problem-solving, collaboration, and
                        human-centered design into every moment, ensuring each solution is secure, user-friendly, and
                        built to last.</p>

                    <h2>Fun Facts About Me</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I speak three languages: English, Vietnamese, and conversational Mandarin, and love the
                            mental stretch of switching between them.</li>
                        <li>I was born and raised in Saigon’s vibrant south, but childhood visits to my dad’s family in
                            Taiwan immersed me in traditional Chinese values and shaped my maturity.</li>
                        <li>In my free time, you’ll find me weight-training at the gym. It keeps me in peak shape and
                            fuels the stamina I need to move fast in life.</li>
                        <li>I’m a perpetual learner: whether I’m studying Chinese, diving into self-development books,
                            or watching growth-mindset videos, I’m always leveling up both as a PM and in life.</li>
